OOP:
    Object oriented programming
    1.Object
    2.Class
    3.Encapsulation
    4.Abstraction
    5.Inheritance
        1.Single
        2.Multi-level
        3.Hierarchical
    6.Polymorphism
        1.Compile Time
            - Method overloading
        2.Run Time
            - Method overriding


Strings:

-String objects are handled specially by the compiler
-String is the only class which has implicit instantiation
-The string class is defined int the java.lang
-String are immutable






Throw:
- Used to explicitly throw an exception
- Checked exception cannot be propagated using throw
- Throw is followed by an instance
- Throw is used within the method
- You cannot throw multiple exceptions

Throws:
-

ArrayList,LinkedList,Vector :\
1.It is a dynamic array or a growable array,
2.It accepts duplicates
3.Data manipulation is supported


Multi Processing:
- Multiple processes running concurrently. This ability is know as multi processing.
- Each processs have it's own address memory, each process allocates seperate memory area
- OS allocates the resources to a process
- Process is heavy weight
- Cost of communication between the process is high

- Contains one or more threads( single threaded or multi threaded)

Thread:
- It is a separate path of execution
- Theads are independent, if there are exceptions in one thread, it doesn't affect other threads.
- It share common memory area.
- java.land.Thread class in java provides support for threads. Each threads
